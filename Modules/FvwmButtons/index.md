# FvwmButtons

## Module Description

The FvwmButtons module provides a window of buttons which sits on the X
terminal's root  window.  The user  can  press  the  buttons at any time,
and trigger invocation of a user-specified command by the window manager.
FvwmButtons only works when fvwm is used as the window manager.

The buttonbox can be of any configuration or geometry, and can have
monochrome or color icons to repÂ­ resent  the actions which would be
invoked.  Even other applications can be 'swallowed' by the button bar.

Panels that are opened on a button press are available too.  See
CreatingPanels for details.
